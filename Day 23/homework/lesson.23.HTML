    <button><h1>World War II</h1></button>
    <p>World War II or the Second World War <br>
         was a global conflict between two alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers.<br>
          Nearly all of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, <br>
          participated in the conflict, and many invested all available economic, industrial, <br>
          and scientific capabilities in pursuit of total war, blurring the distinction between <br>
           and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of<br>
            population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was <br>
            by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in million fatalities. Millions died due <br>
            to genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake<br>
             of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria, and Japan were occupied, and war crime tribunals were conducted <br>
             against German and Japanese leaders.</p>
