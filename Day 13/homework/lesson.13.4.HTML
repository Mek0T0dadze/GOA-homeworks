<head>The Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, occurs every year on the new moon of the first<br>
     lunar month, about the beginning of spring (Lichun). The exact date can fall any time between January 21 and February 21<br>
      of the Gregorian Calendar. Traditionally, years were marked by one of twelve Earthly Branches, represented by an animal, <br>
      and one of ten Heavenly Stems, which correspond to the five elements. This combination cycles every 60 years. It is the most<br>
       important Chinese celebration of the year.
